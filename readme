First attempt at QC plugin.

Just whipped it together this evening. No documentation :)
Only tried building and running on 10.6 intel, but should work elsewhere.

provide a command path, a working directory, and an argument line.

To build, open in Xcode (3.2), use target => build & copy => <right-click> => build & copy & start.

Test it with the include TestPlugin.qtz project.

I still haven't looked into which (if any) xcode project files to check in.
I did remove all the ones which had my home directory listed.
